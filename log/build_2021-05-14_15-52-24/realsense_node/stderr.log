CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:74 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findrealsense_ros.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this
  project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "realsense_ros", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "realsense_ros"
  with any of the following names:

    realsense_rosConfig.cmake
    realsense_ros-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "realsense_ros" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "realsense_ros_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "realsense_ros" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
